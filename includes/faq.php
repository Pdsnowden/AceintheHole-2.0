          <p class="description"> Watch the weather closely. The show goes on
            no matter what the weather is doing.
            <br>You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event.
             You will be given a band that will hold your chip timing piece
             around your ankle throughout the entire event. Be sure that it is
              snapped tightly. Be sure to have your Chip Timing piece on before
               you start the race and be sure to step over the timing mats after
                each segment of the race.

          <h4 class="heading">Swimming</h4>
          <p class="description">Wetsuits are optional for the swim but will
            provide buoyancy and warmth. However, many people opt for no wetsuit
             for a triathlon so no worries.  We will provide you with a swim cap
              but you will want to bring your own goggles. </p>

          <h4 class="heading">Biking</h4>
          <p class="description">A biking helmet is mandatory.  You will also
             receive 2 stickers in your package with your race number on them.
               The small sticker should go on the front of your helmet.
               The bigger sticker will wrap around your bike frame.  Road or
               mountain bikes are acceptable.  For safety reasons, be sure to
                have end-caps on the end of your handle-bars.</p>

          <h4 class="heading">Running</h4>
          <p class="description"> You must finish the race with your bib number
            on the front of you.  Some people choose to pin it on at the beginning
            of the race and have it on for the whole event so they don’t have
            to worry about it.  Others pin it on a singlet that they put on
            once they finish the swim before they head out for the bike.
            Others use an elastic racing strap that they pin their bib number
             to and then quickly strap it on before they leave for the run.
             Use whatever option feels best for you.

          <p class="description">We currently adhere to the USAT Rules for
            Triathlon &amp; Duathlon.  Important rules include no drafting, you
             must wear a helmet and music is ABSOLUTELY NOT allowed during the
             bike for obvious safety reasons.

          <p class="description">Absolutely no music devices are allowed during
             the bike segment for obvious safety risks and will result
              in immediate disqualification.<br>
            During any running segments, we prefer for athletes to NOT use
            music devices to maximize safety, assure a fair competitive
            environment and assure athletes can hear all course marshal
             instructions. With that said, we also understand that many
             athletes rely on music to help endure the challenge of running.
             To accommodate the needs of our athletes while still assuring
             maximum safety and a fair, competitive environment, here is the
              arrangement that we can accommodate.</p>
